# Sliding Panel

Adds a responsive sliding panel to the top of your WordPress-powered site.

The Sliding Panel plugin creates a new sidebar for your site that allows you to add widgets.  These widgets appear within a responsive sliding panel at the top of your site on the front end.

## Features

* It's a jQuery-powered sliding panel.  That's a feature in-and-of itself, right?
* Uses widgets, so you can add pretty much anything you can add to any other sidebar.
* Uses the WordPress-packaged jQuery.
* Will automatically display with any correctly-coded theme.
* Supports HTML5 and Schema.org microdata.
* It's responsive, so it'll look good on any device.

## Changelog

### Version 0.2.0

* Recoded the entire plugin from the ground up.
* Plugin now displays with all correctly-coded themes.
* Added an admin settings page to customize the open/close labels.

### Version 0.1.0

* Plugin launch.  Everything's new!
